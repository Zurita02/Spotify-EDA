# Spotify-EDA
Description:
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on my favorite Spotify songs. The main goal is to understand my listening patterns, genre preferences, and habits regarding new releases.

Project Objectives:
	1.	Extract data from the Spotify API about my liked songs, including:
    •	 Song ID
  	•	Name, artist, and album
  	•	Music genres
  	•	Popularity
  	•	Duration
  	•	Date added (added_at)
  	•	Release date (released)
   
	2.	Clean and standardize music genres, including:
  	•	Assign genres to artists originally listed as Unknown
  	•	Group subgenres into main categories (Top 10 + Other)
   
	3.	Create visualizations and analyses to answer questions such as:
  	•	Which genres do I listen to the most?
  	•	Which artists dominate my library?
  	•	Am I among the first to like newly released songs?
  	•	Distribution of duration, popularity, and explicit/non-explicit content
   
Technologies and Libraries Used:
	•	Python 3
	•	Pandas
	•	Matplotlib / Seaborn
	•	Spotipy (for connecting to the Spotify API)

Expected Outcomes:
A clean, enriched dataset of my favorite songs, along with clear visualizations of my listening habits and musical preferences. This project demonstrates skills in:
	•	Data extraction from APIs
	•	Data cleaning and transformation
	•	Category grouping and mapping
	•	Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
	•	Visualization of insights
